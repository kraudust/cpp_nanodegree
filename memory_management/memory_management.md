# Overview of Memory Types
## Memory Addresses and Hexadecimal Numbers

Inside each computer, all numbers, characters, commands and every imaginable type of information are represented in binary form. Over the years, many coding schemes and techniques were invented to manipulate these 0s and 1s effectively. One of the most widely used schemes is called ASCII (_American Standard Code for Information Interchange_), which lists the binary code for a set of 127 characters. The idea was to represent each letter with a sequence of binary numbers so that storing texts on in computer memory and on hard (or floppy) disks would be possible.

There are several reasons why it is preferable to use hex numbers instead of binary numbers (which computers store at the lowest level), three of which are given below:

1. **Readability**: It is significantly easier for a human to understand hex numbers as they resemble the decimal numbers we are used to. It is simply not intuitive to look at binary numbers and decide how big they are and how they relate to another binary number.
    
2. **Information density**: A hex number with two digits can express any number from 0 to 255 (because 16^2 is 256). To do the same in the binary system, we would require 8 digits. This difference is even more pronounced as numbers get larger and thus harder to deal with.
    
3. **Conversion into bytes**: Bytes are units of information consisting of 8 bits. Almost all computers are byte-addressed, meaning all memory is referenced by byte, instead of by bit. Therefore, using a counting system that can easily convert into bytes is an important requirement. We will shortly see why grouping bits into a byte plays a central role in understanding how computer memory works.

## Using the GDB Debugger to Analyze Memory

See [debugger_analyze_memory.cpp](debugger_analyze_memory.cpp) for an example of how to debug. To build with debugging symbols
```
g++ -g debugger_analyze_memory.cpp
```

To start gdb debugger:
```
gdb a.out
```
When gdb displays the lineÂ `Type <RET> for more, q to quit, c to continue without paging`, be sure to press the RETURN key to continue.

See [GDB Cheat Sheet](gdb_cheat_sheet.pdf) for gdb commands.

For this example, to set a breakpoint at line 5, run the program, step to the next line, and display variable value and address of variable, do the following:
```
break 5
run
step
p str1
p &str1
```

Now to print what's at the memory addresses:
```
(gdb) p str1
$3 = "UDACITY"
(gdb) p &str1
$4 = (char (*)[8]) 0x7fffffffdc60
(gdb) x/7tb 0x7fffffffdc60
0x7fffffffdc60: 01010101        01000100        01000001        01000011        01001001        01010100        01011001
(gdb) x/7xb 0x7fffffffdc60
0x7fffffffdc60: 0x55    0x44    0x41    0x43    0x49    0x54    0x59
(gdb) x/7cb 0x7fffffffdc60
0x7fffffffdc60: 85 'U'  68 'D'  65 'A'  67 'C'  73 'I'  84 'T'  89 'Y'
(gdb) x/7db 0x7fffffffdc60
0x7fffffffdc60: 85      68      65      67      73      84      89
```
The 7 says to print 7 units, the t stands for binary, the x stands for hex, the c stands for char (read as int, but use ascii to print char), the d is just as an int. And the b in the 3rd character stands for bytes. See GDB Cheat Sheet (linked above) for more options.

There is also an [online gdb application](https://www.onlinegdb.com) you can use to debug code.
