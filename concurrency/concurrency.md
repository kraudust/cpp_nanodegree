# Introduction and Running Threads
## Processes and Threads
In this lesson, you will learn how to start and manage your first parallel path of execution, which runs concurrently with the main program and is thus asynchronous. In contrast to synchronous programs, the main program can continue with its line of execution without the need to wait for the parallel task to complete. The following figure illustrates this difference.

![](images/c2-2-a2a.png)

Before we start writing a first asynchronous program in C++, let us take a look at the differences between two important concepts : processes and threads.

A _process_ (also called a task) is a computer program at runtime. It is comprised of the runtime environment provided by the operating system (OS), as well as of the embedded binary code of the program during execution. A process is controlled by the OS through certain actions with which it sets the process into one of several carefully defined states:

![](images/c2-2-a2b.png)

- **Ready** : After its creation, a process enters the ready state and is loaded into main memory. The process now is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time to be executed. Processes that are ready for execution by the CPU are stored in a queue managed by the OS.
- **Running** : The operating system has selected the process for execution and the instructions within the process are executed on one or more of the available CPU cores.
- **Blocked** : A process that is blocked is one that is waiting for an event (such as a system resource becoming available) or the completion of an I/O operation.
- **Terminated** : When a process completes its execution or when it is being explicitly killed, it changes to the "terminated" state. The underlying program is no longer executing, but the process remains in the process table as a "zombie process". When it is finally removed from the process table, its lifetime ends.
- **Ready suspended** : A process that was initially in ready state but has been swapped out of main memory and placed onto external storage is said to be in suspend ready state. The process will transition back to ready state whenever it is moved to main memory again.
- **Blocked suspended** : A process that is blocked may also be swapped out of main memory. It may be swapped back in again under the same conditions as a "ready suspended" process. In such a case, the process will move to the blocked state, and may still be waiting for a resource to become available.

Processes are managed by the _scheduler_ of the OS. The scheduler can either let a process run until it ends or blocks (non-interrupting scheduler), or it can ensure that the currently running process is interrupted after a short period of time. The scheduler can switch back and forth between different active processes (interrupting scheduler), alternately assigning them CPU time. The latter is the typical scheduling strategy of any modern operating system.

Since the administration of processes is computationally taxing, operating systems support a more resource-friendly way of realizing concurrent operations: the threads.

A _thread_ represents a concurrent execution unit within a process. In contrast to full-blown processes as described above, threads are characterized as light-weight processes (LWP). These are significantly easier to create and destroy: In many systems the creation of a thread is up to 100 times faster than the creation of a process. This is especially advantageous in situations, when the need for concurrent operations changes dynamically.

![](images/c2-2-a2c.png)

Threads exist within processes and share their resources. As illustrated by the figure above, a process can contain several threads or - if no parallel processing is provided for in the program flow - only a single thread.

A major difference between a process and a thread is that each process has its own address space, while a thread does not require a new address space to be created. All the threads in a process can access its shared memory. Threads also share other OS dependent resources such as processors, files, and network connections. As a result, the management overhead for threads is typically less than for processes. Threads, however, are not protected against each other and must carefully synchronize when accessing the shared process resources to avoid conflicts.

Similar to processes, threads exist in different states, which are illustrated in the figure below:

![](images/c2-2-a2d.png)

- **New** : A thread is in this state once it has been created. Until it is actually running, it will not take any CPU resources.
- **Runnable** : In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready to run at any instant of time. It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to assign CPU time to the thread.
- **Blocked** : A thread might be in this state, when it is waiting for I/O operations to complete. When blocked, a thread cannot continue its execution any further until it is moved to the runnable state again. It will not consume any CPU time in this state. The thread scheduler is responsible for reactivating the thread.

**Quiz**

In a concurrent program **Threads** share memory. Thus many **Threads** can access and modify the same memory.

Creating a **Process** is fairly resource-intensive. It is generally more efficient to use several **Threads** withing a **Process**.

In contrast to a **Process**, **Threads** are characterized as light-weight. They are significantly easier to create and destroy.

Inter-**Thread** communication can be faster than inter-**Process** communication.

## Running a Single Thread
### Concurrency Support in C++11
The concurrency support in C++ makes it possible for a program to execute multiple threads in parallel. Concurrency was first introduced into the standard with C++11. Since then, new concurrency features have been added with each new standard update, such as in C++14 and C++17. Before C++11, concurrent behavior had to be implemented using native concurrency support from the OS, using POSIX Threads, or third-party libraries such as BOOST. The standardization of concurrency in C++ now makes it possible to develop cross-platform concurrent programs, which is as significant improvement that saves time and reduces error proneness. Concurrency in C++ is provided by the thread support library, which can be accessed by including the header.

A running program consists of at least one thread. When the main function is executed, we refer to it as the "main thread". Threads are uniquely identified by their thread ID, which can be particularly useful for debugging a program. The code below prints the thread identifier of the main thread and outputs it to the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello concurrent world from main! Thread id = " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The results when run are:
```
Hello concurrent world from main! Thread id = 1
```

Also, it is possible to retrieve the number of concurrent threads supported. The example below prints the number of concurrent threads supported to the console.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main()
{
    unsigned int nThreads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    std::cout << "This machine supports concurrency with " << nThreads << " concurrent threads available" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The results when run are:
```
This machine supports concurrency with 12 concurrent threads available
```

### Starting a second thread
In this section, we will start a second thread in addition to the main thread of our program. To do this, we need to construct a thread object and pass it the function we want to be executed by the thread. Once the thread enters the runnable state, the execution of the associated thread function may start at any point in time.

After the thread object has been constructed, the main thread will continue and execute the remaining instructions until it reaches the end and returns. It is possible that by this point in time, the thread will also have finished. But if this is not the case, the main program will terminate and the resources of the associated process will be freed by the OS. As the thread exists within the process, it can no longer access those resources and thus not finish its execution as intended.

To prevent this from happening and have the main program wait for the thread to finish the execution of the thread function, we need to call `join()` on the thread object. This call will only return when the thread reaches the end of the thread function and block the main thread until then.

The code below shows how to use `join()` to ensure that `main()` waits for the thread `t` to finish its operations before returning. It uses the function `sleep_for()`, which pauses the execution of the respective threads for a specified amount of time. The idea is to simulate some work to be done in the respective threads of execution.

```cpp

```

To compile this code with `g++`, you will need to use the `-pthread` flag. `pthread` adds support for multithreading with the pthreads library, and the option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker:

`g++ example_3.cpp -pthread`

**Note:** If you compile without the `-pthread` flag, you will see an error of the form: `undefined reference to pthread_create`. You will need to use the `-pthread` flag for all other multithreaded examples in this course going forward.

The code produces the following output:
```
Finished work in main
Finished work in thread
```

Not surprisingly, the main function finishes before the thread because the delay inserted into the thread function is much larger than in the main path of execution. The call to `join()` at the end of the main function ensures that it will not prematurely return. As an experiment, comment out `t.join()` and execute the program. What do you expect will happen?

```
Finished work in main
terminate called without an active exception
Aborted (core dumped)
```

### Randomness of events
One very important trait of concurrent programs is their non-deterministic behavior. It can not be predicted which thread the scheduler will execute at which point in time. In the code below, the amount of work to be performed both in the thread function and in main has been split into two separate jobs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadFunction()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work 1 in thread\n"; 

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); 
    std::cout << "Finished work 2 in thread\n"; 
}

int main()
{
    // create thread
    std::thread t(threadFunction);

    // do something in main()
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work 1 in main\n";

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); 
    std::cout << "Finished work 2 in main\n";
    
    // wait for thread to finish
    t.join();

    return 0;
}
```

The console output shows that the work packages in both threads have been interleaved with the first package being performed before the second package.

Interestingly, when executed on my local machine, the order of execution has changed. Now, instead of finishing the second work package in the thread first, main gets there first.

Executing the code several times more shows that the two versions of program output interchange in a seemingly random manner. This element of randomness is an important characteristic of concurrent programs and we have to take measures to deal with it in a controlled way that prevent unwanted behavior or even program crashes.

```
Finished work 1 in main
Finished work 1 in thread
Finished work 2 in main
Finished work 2 in thread
```

```
Finished work 1 in thread
Finished work 1 in main
Finished work 2 in thread
Finished work 2 in main
```

### Using join as a barrier
In the previous example, the order of execution is determined by the scheduler. If we wanted to ensure that the thread function completed its work before the main function started its own work (because it might be waiting for a result to be available), we could achieve this by repositioning the call to join.

In the file below, the `.join()` has been moved to before the work in `main()`. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadFunction()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work 1 in thread\n"; 

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); 
    std::cout << "Finished work 2 in thread\n"; 
}

int main()
{
    // create thread
    std::thread t(threadFunction);
    
    // wait for thread to finish
    t.join();

    // do something in main()
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work 1 in main\n";

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); 
    std::cout << "Finished work 2 in main\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The order of execution now always looks like the following:

```
Finished work 1 in thread
Finished work 2 in thread
Finished work 1 in main
Finished work 2 in main
```

In later sections of this course, we will make extended use of the join() function to carefully control the flow of execution in our programs and to ensure that results of thread functions are available and complete where we need them to be.

### Detach
Let us now take a look at what happens if we don’t join a thread before its destructor is called. When we comment out join in the example above and then run the program again, it aborts with an error. The reason why this is done is that the designers of the C++ standard wanted to make debugging a multi-threaded program easier: Having the program crash forces the programer to remember joining the threads that are created in a proper way. Such a hard error is usually much easier to detect than soft errors that do not show themselves so obviously.

There are some situations however, where it might make sense to not wait for a thread to finish its work. This can be achieved by "detaching" the thread, by which the internal state variable "joinable" is set to "false". This works by calling the `detach()` method on the thread. The destructor of a detached thread does nothing: It neither blocks nor does it terminate the thread. In the following example, detach is called on the thread object, which causes the main thread to immediately continue until it reaches the end of the program code and returns. Note that a detached thread can not be joined ever again.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadFunction()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work in thread\n"; 
}

int main()
{
    // create thread
    std::thread t(threadFunction);

    // detach thread and continue with main
    t.detach();

    // do something in main()
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Finished work in main\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Programmers should be very careful though when using the `detach()`-method. You have to make sure that the thread does not access any data that might get out of scope or be deleted. Also, we do not want our program to terminate with threads still running. Should this happen, such threads will be terminated very harshly without giving them the chance to properly clean up their resources - what would usually happen in the destructor. So a well-designed program usually has a well-designed mechanism for joining all threads before exiting.

#### Quiz
Please create a new function called `threadFunctionOdd` that outputs the string "Odd threadn". Then write a for-loop that starts 6 threads and immediately detaches them. Based on wether the increment variable is even or odd, you should pass the respective function to the thread.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadFunctionEven()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Even thread\n";
}

/* Student Task START */
void threadFunctionOdd()
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1)); // simulate work
    std::cout << "Odd thread\n";
}
/* Student Task END */

int main()
{
    /* Student Task START */
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            std::thread t(threadFunctionEven);
            t.detach();
        } else {
            std::thread t(threadFunctionOdd);
            t.detach();
        }
    }
    /* Student Task END */

    // ensure that main does not return before the threads are finished
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1)); // simulate work

    std::cout << "End of main is reached" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output varies each time program is run, but here is one example:
```
Odd thread
Even thread
Even thread
Odd thread
Even thread
End of main is reached
Odd thread
Odd thread
```

The order in which even and odd threads are executed changes. Also, some threads are executed after the main function reaches its end. When `sleep_for` is removed, threads will not finish before the program terminates. And the output is:

```
End of main is reached
```

## Starting a Thread with Function Objects
In the previous section, we have created our first thread by passing it a function to execute. We did not discuss this concept in depth at the time, but in this section we will focus on the details of passing functions to other functions, which is one form of a _callable object_.

In C++, callable objects are object that can appear as the left-hand operand of the call operator. These can be pointers to functions, objects of a class that defines an overloaded function call operator and _lambdas_ (an anonymous inline function), with which function objects can be created in a very simple way. In the context of concurrency, we can use callable objects to attach a function to a thread.

In the last section, we constructed a thread object by passing a function to it without any arguments. If we were limited to this approach, the only way to make data available from within the thread function would be to use global variables - which is definitely not recommendable and also incredibly messy.

In this section, we will therefore look at several ways of passing data to a thread function.

The `std::thread` constructor can also be called with instances of classes that implement the function-call operator. In the following, we will thus define a class that has an overloaded `()`-operator. In preparation for the final project of this course, which will be a traffic simulation with vehicles moving through intersections in a street grid, we will define a (very) early version of the Vehicle class in this example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
    void operator()()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle object has been created \n" << std::endl;
    }
};


int main()
{
    // create thread 
    std::thread t(Vehicle()); // C++'s most vexing parse

    // do something in main()
    std::cout << "Finished work in main \n";

    // wait for thread to finish
    t.join();

    return 0;
}
```

When executing this code, the clang++ compiler generates a warning, which is followed by an error:

A similar error is shown when compiling with g++:

`error: request for member ‘join’ in ‘t’, which is of non-class type ‘std::thread(Vehicle (*)())’      t.join();`

So you will see an error when you compile `example_1.cpp`!

The extra parentheses suggested by the compiler avoid what is known as C++'s "most vexing parse", which is a specific form of syntactic ambiguity resolution in the C++ programming language.

The expression was coined by Scott Meyers in 2001, who talks about it in details in his book "Effective STL". The "most vexing parse" comes from a rule in C++ that says that anything that could be considered as a function declaration, the compiler should parse it as a function declaration - even if it could be interpreted as something else.

In the previous code example, the line 
```cpp
std::thread t(Vehicle());
```

is seemingly ambiguous, since it could be interpreted either as

1. a variable definition for variable `t` of class `std::thread`, initialized with an anonymous instance of class Vehicle or
2. a function declaration for a function `t` that returns an object of type `std::thread` and has a single (unnamed) parameter that is a pointer to function returning an object of type `Vehicle`

Most programmers would presumable expect the first case to be true, but the C++ standard requires it to be interpreted as the second - hence the compiler warning.

There are three ways of forcing the compiler to consider the line as the first case, which would create the thread object we want:

- Add an extra pair of parentheses
- Use copy initialization
- Use uniform initialization with braces

The following code shows all three variants:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
    void operator()()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle object has been created \n";
    }
};


int main()
{
    // create thread 
    //std::thread t0(Vehicle()); // C++'s most vexing parse
    
    std::thread t1( (Vehicle()) ); // Add an extra pair of parantheses
    
    std::thread t2 = std::thread( Vehicle() ); // Use copy initialization
    
    std::thread t3{ Vehicle() };// Use uniform initialization with braces

    // do something in main()
    std::cout << "Finished work in main \n";

    // wait for thread to finish
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this code sample shows that all three threads are executed and the Vehicle object is properly initialized:

```
Vehicle object has been created 
Vehicle object has been created 
Finished work in main 
Vehicle object has been created 
```

Whichever option we use, the idea is the same: the function object is copied into internal storage accessible to the new thread, and the new thread invokes the operator `()`. The `Vehicle` class can of course have data members and other member functions too, and this is one way of passing data to the thread function: pass it in as a constructor argument and store it as a data member:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
    Vehicle(int id) : _id(id) {}
    void operator()()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle #" << _id << " has been created" << std::endl;
    }

private:
    int _id;
};

int main()
{
    // create thread
    std::thread t = std::thread(Vehicle(1)); // Use copy initialization

    // do something in main()
    std::cout << "Finished work in main \n";

    // wait for thread to finish
    t.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code example, the class `Vehicle` has a constructor that takes an integer and it will store it internally in a variable `_id`. In the overloaded function call operator, the vehicle id is printed to the console. In `main()`, we are creating the `Vehicle` object using copy initialization. The output of the program is given below:

```
Finished work in main
Vehicle #1 has been created
```

As can easily be seen, the integer ID has been successfully passed into the thread function.
